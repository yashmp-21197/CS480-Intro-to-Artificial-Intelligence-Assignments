Please answer the following questions.

1. **Question:** What do you think "artificial intelligence" means?

    A: I think artificial intelligence is a kind of intelligence developed by humans artificially for any kind of machine to solve real-world problems with more accurately and human thoughts. 

1. **Question:** What are your expectations from this class?

    A: My expectations from this class are as follow,
	-	a better understanding of AI topics.
	-	general knowledge of AI.
	-	should be capable of thinking and developing AI apps.

1. **Question:** I'd like to understand how much interest you have in the theory of AI versus its applications. Assuming you are given a total of 10 balls and two buckets: a theory bucket and an applications bucket, how many of the 10 balls would you put in the theory bucket (assuming the remaining ones go to the applications bucket)?

    A: I would put 6 balls in theory bucket and 4 balls in applications bucket. because I believe that theory is the base of any applications and it will help to understand and implement AI applications. But, theory and its applications should be connected with each other.

1. **Question:** You might be interested in learning many AI topics, but if you had to choose only one, what would you pick?

    A: I would pick Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
    
1. **Question:** Would you be interested in carrying out a multi-week AI project? If so, do you have any AI project in mind?

    A: Yes, I would be interested in carrying out a multi-week AI project. But, I don't have any AI project in mind.

1. **Question:** Any other comments and suggestions?

    A: Lecture should be covered and discussed with the latest AI topics and how they are related to old AI topics and technologies and some guidelines to implement it from scratch.
